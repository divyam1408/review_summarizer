I never treated it badly, it stays at my computer desk. I woke up one morning to notice it didnt work anymore.

Unfortunately one of the cords has separated from the ear piece and is not repairable. I cant say if this is due to rough usage (i am pretty careful with my things) or due to the cord being too flimsy. Either way, i am purchasing the same model to replace it because you cant beat the quality for the price.",4.0

I've always been iffy about buying headsets online since you cannot really try them on for a fit, but as I read in other reviews, you can adjust them for a better fit by leaving them overnight to stretch using books.
